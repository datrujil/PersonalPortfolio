# PersonalPortfolio

## Brief Overview
This project is my personal portfolio, detailing what I do, what my goals are, as well as my projects. My website does currently contain placeholders as I do not have a lot of personal projects created to fill in my works page. This catalog will grow further down the line. Additionally, JavaScript will be implemented later to create Single Work HTML pages that go into further detail of each project, though I haven't decided yet how I want those pages to look like.
It includes the following pages on a navigation bar:
- Home Page - Contains introduction, resume download, recent posts, and featured works
- Works Page - Contains all projects
- Posts Pafe - Contains all posts created
- About Page - Contains brief description of myself
- Contact Page - Contains a contact form you can fill out and submit to reach out to me

## Known Errors on Validation Files
`valid-accessability*.jpeg`: Incorrectly identifies icons html code as italics and identifies that an h4 header can not come after an h1 header.

`valid-css*.jpeg`: Incorrectly identifies that animation-timeline property does not exist. If I leave those lines off of my code, my scroll animations stop to work.

## Number of Assignment Points
I believe I deserve 15 on points for this assignment.
